## Command Line Interface for Phones

### "Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface." - Peter H. Salus

This project is not a port of a terminal to android, nor is it yet-another-messaging-app.
The end goal of this project is create a desktop CLI equivalent for phones. 

Imagine doing everything through a simple text box.
 * Basic Utilities
   * Set an Alarm
   * Get the Weather
   * Use a Calculator
   * Write Notes
   * Set Reminders
 * Search Google/DuckDuckGo/Yahoo/Wikipedia
 * Social Media
   * Make a post
   * Read your news feed
 * Basic Communication
   * Talk over one message stream
   * Choose any medium to talk through all in one place
 * Hail a cab
 * Order a pizza
 * Using a smart assistant without talking to it
 * Command your army of smart devices

That is the purpose of this project, one interface, one text box, one screen, millions of options.
